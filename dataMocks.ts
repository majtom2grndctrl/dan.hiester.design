Back then, the Wipeout video game series was a gateway drug that introduced me to The Designers Republic. I remember the Future Sound of London’s site being one of the earliest rich media experiences I saw on the web, an angsty and foreboding experience that was just as much an expression of angst and social disconnection as the group’s seminal 1996 album, Dead Cities.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"When Radiohead released A Moon Shaped Pool to the public, the album’s website filled me with nostolgia. There it was, in all caps: “RADIOHEAD”. In every variation of Radiohead’s logo, I always felt like it had a particularly hideous capital A. This new site was the real deal. Back in the day, in order to get such ugly, unsettling-looking typography onto a website, we had to resort to using a gif, or a Flash movie. But now, in 2016, we can reproduce that angsty look with embeddable web type.

The piece, covering brutalistwebsites.com, drew obvious comparisons with the popular architectural style of the 1970s, and pointed out that some brutalist-looking sites have always been popular. Reading through the piece, and some of the comments, I was surprised how many people acted shocked that anyone would intentionally make something ugly.","spans":[{"start":34,"end":74,"type":"hyperlink","data":{"link_type":"Web","url":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/05/09/the-hottest-trend-in-web-design-is-intentionally-ugly-unusable-sites/"}},{"start":141,"end":162,"type":"hyperlink","data":{"link_type":"Web","url":"http://brutalistwebsites.com/"}},{"start":433,"end":446,"type":"em"}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"“This is web art not web design”, one commenter said.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"“Congratulations on making your philosophical point, you design rebels, you”, said another.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"These two comments make some valid observations, but I think under a lens of constructive criticism, a designer can take these points further. I think a designer should look at these sites constructively. Pointing to a problem without offering a solution is also known as whining.

If all creative work rests somewhere in a continuum between form and function, these brutalists sites lean more in favor of form than function. Having said that, people who work with design every day shouldn’t be shocked at an intentionally unattractive design. There are plenty of valid reasons, which often aren’t strictly philosophical.","spans":[{"start":356,"end":385,"type":"em"}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"One example: Brands need to feel authentic to connect with audiences.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"While I haven’t seen any brand guidelines for Radiohead, I feel like I can guess some of the themes they want to evoke. Anyone should be able to look at a Radiohead album cover, and be able to tell it isn’t music popular people like. Radiohead’s music connects to people who’ve never felt popular. Or maybe it’s the one thing that connects with the popular people when they have a bad day.

It’s helpful to make sure a project’s stakeholders agree about which emotions they want to convey, and share some consensus of how. Mood boards can help you ask questions, like, “What do you like about this particular design? What feeling do you get from looking at it, and why do you think it affects you that way?” After everyone gets their cards on the table, you are in a much better position to steer the project in the best direction.","spans":[{"start":39,"end":52,"type":"em"},{"start":59,"end":73,"type":"em"},{"start":138,"end":143,"type":"em"},{"start":202,"end":205,"type":"em"}]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Without having that conversation, different stakeholders often have different visions for a project, resulting in them sending you mixed signals.

Most of  the research I’ve read in the last few years has blasted “the fold”, as  an outdated notion – a holdover from an era when content was generally  published in only one format. Luke Wrobelewski even published a Tumblr  site, dubbed “There is no fold”.  I think the Nielsen Norman Group article argues a couple of interesting  points, but there are a few other considerations that designers should  think about, too.","spans":[{"start":373,"end":391,"type":"hyperlink","data":{"link_type":"Web","url":"http://thereisnofold.tumblr.com/"}}]},{"type":"heading2","text":"The biggest obstacle isn’t how audiences react to the page fold, but the page turn","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"…Most of the time, users don’t even click on a link to a page unless the it’s promising enough.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"I was alarmed when I read: “Users do scroll, but only if  what’s above the fold is promising enough”.
