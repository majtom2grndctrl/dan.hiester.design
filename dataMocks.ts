Luke Wrobelewski even published a Tumblr  site, dubbed “There is no fold”.  I think the Nielsen Norman Group article argues a couple of interesting  points, but there are a few other considerations that designers should  think about, too.","spans":[{"start":373,"end":391,"type":"hyperlink","data":{"link_type":"Web","url":"http://thereisnofold.tumblr.com/"}}]},{"type":"heading2","text":"The biggest obstacle isn’t how audiences react to the page fold, but the page turn","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"…Most of the time, users don’t even click on a link to a page unless the it’s promising enough.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"I was alarmed when I read: “Users do scroll, but only if  what’s above the fold is promising enough”.
