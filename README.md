## Design Inspiration and Design Persona

The main theme I intend to explore with this redesign is to issue an invitation to join an expedition with a seasoned explorer.

This redesign is inspired heavily by the Swedish Style and International Style. This style of graphic design coincided with a massive surge in global travel, thanks to revolutionary shifts in technology starting in the first half of the 20th century.

Seattle’s history has close ties with Nordic tradition, and this style of graphic design is also seen by many as timeless. Compared with the sunny weather celebrated down the Pacific coast, Seattle’s weather sets a somber tone.

The design persona is a seasoned explorer. They have seen a lot, and do not seem surprised by the unexpected. They aren’t fazed by a wall of gray fog, because they have already been to the other side and back. Their calm, collected demeanor blends into the tranquility of pristine but unexuberant environments of the Pacific Northwest.

## Design and development process

Shipping an ambitious website on the first release is hard and risky. In order to ship fast, and collect data to inform course corrections, it helps to launch a Minimum Viable Product as early in the process as possible.

This site has three planned phases for launch, with potential for a fourth "stretch-goal" release:

1. Landing page
   * **Scope** One page with art and CTA to request portfolio by email.
2. Portfolio only
   * **Scope** Portfolio index, case study layout, frequent content updates.
3. Portfolio and blog
   * **Scope** Blog index, repurpose layout code from case study, frequent content updates.
4. Stretch goal
   * **Scope** Add metadata to case studies and apply the metadata to new website routes, to allow custom user journeys for recruiters and clients with different interests.
