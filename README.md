## Design and development process

Shipping an ambitious website on the first release is hard and risky. In order to ship fast, and collect data to inform course corrections, it helps to launch a Minimum Viable Product as early in the process as possible.

This site has three planned phases for launch, with potential for a fourth "stretch-goal" release:

1. Landing page
   * **Scope** One page with art and CTA to request portfolio by email.
2. Portfolio only
   * **Scope** Portfolio index, case study layout, frequent content updates.
3. Portfolio and blog
   * **Scope** Blog index, repurpose layout code from case study, frequent content updates.
4. Stretch goal
   * **Scope** Add metadata to case studies and apply the metadata to new website routes, to allow custom user journeys for recruiters and clients with different interests.
